# ProblemSolving
this project is going to be composed of different files, of c / c++  programs, so that i am going to learn problem solving , algorithms and data strecture in order to boost my capabilites, in problem solving. 

# Journeling the Joureny : 
so this is basically jouernaling my jouerny in learning competitive programming and problem solving, after doing some reserach , here are the various
ressources that I am going to use: 
I have found this github repo which I found really intresting: https://github.com/BedirT/ACM-ICPC-Preparation 
also , I am going to focus on Codeforces, codingame and leetcode as primary ressources of problems. 
here is also an amazing thread on the blog of codeforces, which provides a great sheet of problems : https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/119492 

# HARD WORK, WORKS. 
In the end, I would like to quote my favourite quote : 
# "It's a lot of hard work, but if you put your heart into it, you will certainly be successful"
